# AG Guest Passes

Asphalt Green welcomes many types of visitors to its facilities. Between staff, members, and program participants, many visits are predictable and have some sort of recurrence. This solution attempts to provide systems for collecting, tracking, and reporting on visitor invitations that donâ€™t fall into these categories. Some examples include

* A single-use day pass purchase for fitness and/or pool use
* A tour for a prospective member
* A meeting or tour with a donor
