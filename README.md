# AG Guest Passes

Asphalt Green welcomes many types of visitors to its facilities. Between staff, members, and program participants, many visits are predictable and have some sort of recurrence. This solution attempts to provide systems for collecting, tracking, and reporting on visitor invitations that donâ€™t fall into these categories. Some examples include:

* A single-use day pass purchase for fitness and/or pool use
* A tour for a prospective member
* A meeting or tour with a donor

This project interacts heavily with the Guests, Packages, and Temporary Cards project and contains some overlapping functionality. A Guest Pass represents something like a ticket, authorizing access for an individual to a particular facility on a one-time basis, and is covered in this document. A Guest Visit represents the details of a one-time visit, whether granted by Guest Pass or not. Guest Visits and related functionality are discussed in the Guests, Packages, and Temporary Cards documentation.
